# Types

## Comments

```coffeescript
###
Large
  Comment
Block
###

# Inline comment

foo = "bar"  # end of line comment
```

In Storyscript, comments are denoted by the `#` character to the end of a line,
or from `###` to the end of the line of the next appearance of `###`.

## Boolean

Truth values can be represented with the `boolean` type that has two possible values (`true` and `false`):

```coffeescript
happy = true
sad = false
```
## Numbers

Numbers in Storyscript can be whole numbers (`int`s) that can be positive, negative or zero:

```coffeescript
i  = 1
i2 = -2
i3 = 0
```

Integers are unlimited in size and have no minimum or maximum value.

Additionally, Storyscript can represent numbers with decimals as floating-point numbers (`float`):

```coffeescript
f1 = 1.2
f2 = -3.14
```

The engine uses IEEE-754 double precision floating point arithmetic.

## Strings

```coffeescript
data = "foobar"

long_string = "Hi Friend,
This is a lo\
ng string."
# Hi Friend, This is a long string.

more_data = """
    The quick brown fox
    jumps over the lazy dog.
"""
# The quick brown fox\njumps over the lazy dog.

where = "Earth"
data_formatted = "Hello, {where}"
# Hello, Earth
```

::: v-pre
Like many traditional programming languages, Storyscript supports strings as delimited by the `"` or `'` characters.
Storyscript also supports string interpolation within "-quoted strings, using `{ expression }`.
Single-quoted strings are literal. You may even use interpolation in object keys.
:::

Multi-line strings are allowed in Storyscript.
Lines are joined by a single space unless they end with a backslash.
Indentation is ignored.

Block strings, delimited by `"""` or `'''`, can be used to hold formatted or indentation-sensitive text (or, if you just donâ€™t feel like escaping quotes and apostrophes).
The indentation level that begins the block is maintained throughout, so you can keep it all aligned with the body of your code.

Double-quoted block strings, like other double-quoted strings, allow interpolation.

### String indexing

A string index is zero-based.
A string index may be negative and will then start from the end. The absolute value
of an index may not be equal or greater than the length of the string.

```coffeescript
s = "abcd"
s[0]  # a
s[3]  # d
s[-1] # d
s[-3] # a
s[4]  # ERROR
s[-4] # ERROR
```

## Lists

Storyscript supports `List`s as a generic container type:

```coffeescript
list_inline = ["string", 1, 2]
list_multiline = [
  1,
  2,
  3
]
```

In a list the same value may occur more than once.
A list index is zero-based.
A list index may be negative and will then start from the end. The absolute value
of an index may not be equal or greater than the length of the list.

```coffeescript
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
l[0]  # 1
l[3]  # 4
l[-1] # 4
l[-3] # 1
l[4]  # ERROR
l[-4] # ERROR
```

## Maps

Storyscript supports `Map`s as a generic container type:

```coffeescript
map_inline = {'foo': 'bar', 'apples': 'oranges'}
map_multiline = {
  'foo': 'bar',
  'apples': 'oranges'
}
object_int = {1: 11, 2: 22}
```

In a map the same value may occur more than once, but the same key can only occur once.

Maps can be destructured into its part with the destructuring assignments:

```coffeescript
map = {'foo': 'bar', 'apples': 'oranges'}
{ foo } = map
# foo = 'bar'
```

A destructuring assignment must contain one or more object keys.
These keys **must** exist in the map and will be new variables names.
Their value is the value of the respective key in the map (`map[key]`).

```coffeescript
map = {'foo': 'bar', 'apples': 'oranges'}
{ foo, apples } = map
# foo = 'bar', apples = 'oranges'
```

## Time durations

Time durations can be expressed natively.

```coffeescript
timeout  = 30s
duration = 5d10m
```

Supported time units are `w` (weeks)`, `d` (days), `h` (hours)`, `m` (minutes), `s` (seconds) and `ms` (milliseconds).

Time units must be used in this order and can't be repeated.

## Regular Expressions

```coffeescript
pattern = /^foo/i
```

Regular expressions are supported without any special characters of escaping necessary.

### Regular Expressions Methods

```coffeescript
pattern = /(?P<key>\w):(?P<value>\w)/
```
